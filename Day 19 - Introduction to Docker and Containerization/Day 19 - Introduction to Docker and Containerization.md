## What is Containerization?

- Lightweight virtualization
- Runs applications in containers
- Shares host OS kernel
- Packages code, dependencies, settings

## Why Containers?

- Consistency: Solves 'works on my machine'
- Portability: Run anywhere
- Efficiency: Faster, low resource
- Isolation: Self-contained environments

## What is Docker?

- Open platform for containerized apps
- Separates apps from infrastructure
- Written in Go
- Launched: March 20, 2013

## Key Docker Concepts

- Docker Engine: Build and run containers
- Image: Read-only snapshot
- Container: Running image
- Dockerfile: Build script
- Docker Hub: Public image registry

## Why Docker Over VMs?

- VMs are heavy, containers are light
- Containers start in seconds
- Easier to scale
- Higher portability and efficiency

## Docker vs. Virtual Machines

VMs:
- Full OS
- Heavy
- Slower start
Docker:
- Process isolation
- Lightweight
- Faster start

## Docker Architecture

- Docker Engine: Client, Daemon, REST API
- Image: Template
- Container: Executable image
- Registry: Stores images
- Volume: Persistent storage

## Impact of Docker

- Streamlines DevOps (CI/CD)
- Supports microservices
- Cloud-optimized
- Boosts developer productivity

## Real-World Use Cases

- Dev/test environments
- CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud deployments
- Microservices
- Edge/IoT

## Future Outlook

- Kubernetes integration
- Serverless and Edge computing
- Hybrid cloud
- Cloud-native design

## Summary

- Docker vs VMs: Lightweight, portable
- Solves VM limitations
- Key components: Image, Container, etc.
- Next: Build and deploy with Docker
